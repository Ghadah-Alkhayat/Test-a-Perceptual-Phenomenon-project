# Test-a-Perceptual-Phenomenon-project
This is one of my projects for Data Analyst -Udacity nano degree-

## introduction:
In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect.  I created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of an experimental task related to the Stroop Effect and computed some statistics describing the results. Finally, I interpreted the results in terms of my hypotheses.

**the dependent variable is the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists**

**the independent variable is incongruent words list or congruent words list**


H0= the population average naming time for congruent words equals or less than the population average naming time for incongruent words

H1= the population average naming time for incongruent words is greater than the population average naming time for congruent words
